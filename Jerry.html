<p>Jerry is my family cat that we've had basically all my life. We aren't quite sure how old she is, but we think
    she's around 16. She was mostly an outdoor all her life, but has gradually moved toward staying inside rather
    than going out. Either way though, 16 is old for a cat that lays around all day, let alone one that regularly
    hunted for food. Jerry is probably the loudest cat you will ever hear, as she constantly meows for food or
    attention. Anyone that meets her is immediately pulled in by her adorable meows and infectious purring.</p>
