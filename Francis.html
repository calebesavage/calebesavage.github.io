<p>Francis is my parakeet that I've had for over two years now and he is a very interesting bird.
    Our bond is unlike any I've had with any other animal, probably due to the fact that he was my first very own pet.
    Francis is a very smart bird and he loves climb onto peoples'
    phones to get a better look at the screen. He also likes spends hours looking at himself
    in the mirror, sometimes putting his beak right up against it so it looks like he's kissing his reflection.
    Unfortunately Umaine doesn't allow pets in the dorms so I had to
    leave him home with my parents. I get to see him on weekends and breaks though, and he's always so happy to see me.</p>
