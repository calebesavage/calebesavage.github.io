<p>This is my dog Quincy and he's a pretty good boy. He's 11 years old but he still feels like a puppy to me. He is
    always full of energy and ready to meet new people no matter how old he gets. He loves to run around outside and
    roll around in the nastiest stuff he can find. Quincy has had his fair share of bad luck though, including, but not limited to,
    tearing his ACL, getting lyme disease, and getting hit by a car twice! But every time he bounces back to play fetch
    another day.</p>
